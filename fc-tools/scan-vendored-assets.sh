#
# Finds files that a Maven-tree-based license/SBOM scan (Eclipse Dash, CycloneDX
# maven plugin) CANNOT see, because they never go through Maven dependency
# resolution:
#
#   1. Committed .jar files (checked straight into git, not resolved by Maven)
#   2. Maven `system`-scope / `systemPath` dependencies (bypass resolution too)
#   3. Vendored front-end JS/CSS/font libraries checked into static resource
#      dirs (no npm/webpack in this repo, so third-party JS/CSS arrives as
#      committed files, typically under a `lib/` folder or named `*.min.*`)

#                                                   and verify every baselined

#                                                   into an Eclipse Dash license-scanner run.
#
# CI runs --check as a PR gate (reads and diffs, never writes) and the default
# report mode at release time (informational artifact upload). Regenerating
# the baseline after a reviewed vendored-asset change, and updating
# fc-tools/oss-inventory-vendored-assets.csv (Dash-resolvable coordinates) or
# fc-tools/oss-inventory-vendored-assets-manual.csv (everything else) with the
# licence findings for that change, is a manual step for whoever makes it:
#
#   ./fc-tools/scan-vendored-assets.sh --list > fc-tools/vendored-assets-baseline.txt
#
# This complements, it does not replace, the Eclipse Dash / SBOM Maven scans
# already run by .github/workflows/eclipse-dash.yml and sbom.yml — those cover
# a different open question (NF-4b: release-artefact location for the Dash
# scan/SBOM), still open with QA as of the 2026-08-17 response.
