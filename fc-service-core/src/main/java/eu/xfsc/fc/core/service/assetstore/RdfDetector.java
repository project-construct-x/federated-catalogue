/**
 * Determines whether uploaded content should be treated as RDF (and thus go through
 * verification + graph storage) or as a non-RDF asset (stored in FileStore only).
 *
 * <p>Detection is based on a configurable allowlist of RDF MIME types. The only content
 * inspection is for {@code application/json}: a lightweight {@code @context} check
 * distinguishes JSON-LD from plain JSON.</p>
 *
 * <p><b>Note:</b> Not all RDF content types in the allowlist can currently be processed
 * by {@code VerificationService} — only {@code application/ld+json} is fully supported.
 * Other RDF serializations (Turtle, N-Triples, etc.) will be detected as RDF but fail
 * verification. A strategy pattern for format-specific verification would allow each
 * RDF serialization to have its own processing pipeline. For now, operators can remove
 * unsupported types from the allowlist to accept them as non-RDF files instead.</p>
