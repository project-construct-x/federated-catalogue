/**
 * Validates external client identifier URLs (a bundle's {@code serviceUrl} and
 * {@code trustAnchorUrl} overrides) accepted through the admin bundle-config patch endpoint.
 *
 * <p>An admin PATCH lets an operator repoint the outbound compliance client at an arbitrary
 * URL at runtime. Without a scheme/host allowlist this is a server-side request forgery
 * (SSRF) hole: a malicious or hijacked admin session (or CSRF) could aim the catalogue's
 * outbound HTTP client at an internal host or the cloud-metadata address
 * ({@code 169.254.169.254}), and the catalogue would dial it. This validator rejects such
 * targets before they are ever persisted as an override.
 *
 * <p><strong>Scope limitation:</strong> this is a syntactic scheme + reserved-IP-literal
 * check, not a DNS-rebinding-proof network guard. Symbolic hostnames (anything that is not
 * an IP literal) are accepted without any DNS lookup — resolving admin-supplied hostnames at
 * validation time would only close a time-of-check gap, since the resolved address can
 * legitimately change before the outbound call is made (DNS rebinding); a syntactic check
 * cannot close that gap either way, so we do not attempt it here. Operators are expected to
 * only enter hostnames they trust; enforcing the destination at connect time (e.g. an
 * egress proxy or network policy) is the actual defense against DNS rebinding.
