# Federated Catalogue

The Federated Catalogue is an Eclipse XFSC service that makes assets — metadata descriptions of Providers, their Service
Offerings, and Resources — available to Consumers. It supports verifiable-credential-based onboarding and pluggable
trust-framework validation (Gaia-X Loire and standard JWT-VC formats). The service's role within the Gaia-X / XFSC
ecosystem (system scope and context, building-block view) is described in
the [Architecture Document](https://github.com/eclipse-xfsc/docs/tree/main/federated-catalogue).

This project originated as the Reference Implementation
of [Gaia-X Federation Services Lot 5 — Federated Catalogue / Core Catalogue Features](https://www.gxfs.eu/core-catalogue-features/).

## Installation & Setup

The supported way to build and run the Federated Catalogue locally is via the bundled Docker Compose
stack: [Steps to build FC](https://github.com/eclipse-xfsc/federated-catalogue/blob/main/docker/README.md).

The Keycloak realm name is configurable via the `KEYCLOAK_REALM` env var (default
`federated-catalogue-realm`). Existing deployments with a pre-existing `gaia-x` realm keep working by setting
`KEYCLOAK_REALM=gaia-x`. See [Keycloak Realm Configuration](docs/operator-guide.md#keycloak-realm-configuration)
in the operator guide for details.

## Getting started — try the API

Walkthrough guide and scenario demos for new users live under [`examples/`](./examples/README.md): how to ingest assets,
query the graph, and exercise admin-UI behaviour switches. The walkthroughs are curl-based and tool-agnostic. Prefer a
GUI? Import [`openapi/fc_openapi.yaml`](./openapi/fc_openapi.yaml) into your favourite OpenAPI client (Bruno, Insomnia,
Postman, …) for a per-endpoint workspace that stays in sync with the spec.

## Credential support

The catalogue accepts Gaia-X Loire (VC 2.0 JWT) and standard JWT-VC; see
the [Operator Guide](https://github.com/eclipse-xfsc/federated-catalogue/blob/main/docs/operator-guide.md#supported-credential-formats)
for the full matrix and the asset/credential terminology note.
